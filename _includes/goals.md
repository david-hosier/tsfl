# Goals
---
Part of the process of getting healthy is setting goals. My coach Becky has sent me some information on how to more effectively write up goals, so these are a little different than how people normally think of goals being stated. Following are my fundamental goals.

* To get back, as close as I can, to the person I was when I got married. Back then, I was vigorous and active. I owe it to my wife to reverse the terrible departure I've made away from who/what I was.
* To become the father that I always thought I would be. I owe it to my kids to be the kind of Dad that doesn't say 'no' to going to the park because I'm so fat and tired and in pain that I can't even bear the thought. I owe it to my kids to still be around when they graduate from high school. I owe it to my kids to not allow the poor life choices that I've made for myself negatively impact their childhood and keep them from realizing their potential.
* To enjoy life for myself again instead of being emotional, angry, tense, stubborn, scared, tired, sick, lazy, and grumpy. I owe it to all my loved ones to love myself first.
* To be a man that takes control of his life and actually follows through with a plan instead of always feeling sorry for himself and distancing himself from others.

See, I am fairly convinced that all of the problems that my goals hope to address stem from my miserable sorry-ass lifestyle. Poor diet/health, an extreme lack of sleep, and high levels of stress over the course of many years have all combined to beat me down to a shell of a man. The Take Shape For Life plan will be the cornerstone of my return to a healthy weight and life balance. I don't think that diet alone will fully put me on the path to success however. Besides eating healthy, here are some primary goals to support my fundamental goals.

* Ride my bike or walk at least 30 minutes 5 or more days a week.
* Get back into a basketball league and maybe even an indoor soccer league.
* Go to bed at the same time as my wife and get more sleep!
* Reduce stress through a healthy work-life balance and better perspective on general day-to-day events.
* Take more time for my hobbies like playing music.

I fully expect this to be a difficult journey, especially given how far I have to go to reach my goals. I think to feel my best, I need to aim to get down to around 185 pounds. At the time of this writing, I weigh over 235 pounds. This list of goals will server to motivate me daily, and I will savor all the support that I can get. Let the journey begin!
