title: "Almost Ready To Go"
---
Well, my food arrived in the mail today, a day earlier than it was supposed to. So I'm not quite ready to go yet. I'm going to take one more day to finish getting the things I need like my veggies, fats, dressing, etc. I'm a bit nervous now that the time has come to actually do this. This is so important to me though. I think the thing I'm most nervous about is failing. I've been psyching myself up to do this, so I think I'm pretty ready. All the food I've tried so far at Becky's house was decent, but I've only sampled a very small portion...so we'll see how it goes.

My plan is keep data on weight and measurements and see if I can find some kind of javascript graphing library that I can use to keep a live graph of my progress right on the blog's front page. I'm not very javascript savvy, but I'm pretty sure something exists that will fit my need. I also want to figure out how to turn on comments and RSS feeds for anyone that wants to follow my progress and chime in with support or derision.

As for today, I will answer my Week One lesson questions here publicly.

### Action Steps
Rate your feelings about the following statements:

1. I have the power to make choices that will lead me toward optimal health (Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree)

	* Agree. I know I have the power to do it. I also know that I am typically pretty weak-willed. So I'd say I'm anxious, but optimistic that given the sanity of the goals I've chosen for myself, and the insanity of not making the right choices, that I can make it through what it sure to be a tough journey.

2. I am excited about my journey to optimal health (Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree)

	* Strongly Agree. As I said above, I am nervous. However, I am excited to do the right thing for me and my family. I am excited about the prospects of getting healthy and what that will mean for my interactions with my wife and children. I am excited to live a healthy life instead of being sick and pained all the time.

3. The thing I look most forward to on this journey is...

	* Is renewed energy with which to spend time being active with my children. I've barely done even the simplest things with my son, such as throwing a baseball, playing soccer, or teaching him basketball. It's sad, and I'm a bit ashamed of it. My kids are missing out on things because of my poor health and poor choices, and it's time to change.

4. The thing I least look forward to on this journey is...

	* The food. I've been eating unhealthy delicious nasty food almost exclusively for many many years now. It's going to be hard to suddenly stop eating that food. I have lots of cravings for that kind of food. I've cleared most of that junk out though, so the temptation shouldn't be there. It will be good for my family to not have junk around the house as well. I keep hearing that my tastes will change, and I hope that's true...but I have to admit that I'm a little skeptical.

5. List 3 habits that you are now practicing that lead to a less-than-healthy or destructive ends

	* Poor meals. I rarely eat breakfast, and when I do it's usually junk. It's Summer vacation now, but during school, I would be the one take my soon to class in the mornings. Most of the time I'd be too tired to eat at home before leaving, and I have a work meeting that starts shortly after getting home. I feel into a bad habit of stopping at the gas station to pick up disgusting unhealthy foods like donuts, sodas, or energy drinks. I would almost always feel terrible doing it, but I like I said, I'm weak-willed. Most of the time I'd be embarrassed too, so I would stop at different places to avoid seeing the same workers every day. In a way that made it less embarrassing, but it also made it more embarrassing and made me feel worse about myself.
	* Too little sleep. I have a habit of getting on the computer and staying up way too late. I have very little personal time to catch up stuff I like to read on the Internet, so even though I'm usually dead tired, I stay up anyway to get that small bit of time to myself. This almost always leads to me being extremely irritable and short-tempered with my family though, which of course is not fair to them.
	* Procrastination. I'm always telling myself that I'll do this or that later. I'm always going to start walking or riding my bike "tomorrow." For me, "tomorrow" usually means never, and it's terrible. It's also extremely discouraging.

6. List 3 daily choices that, if you adopt them, will move you toward optimal health

	* Be happy. One of my favorite people in the world is [Dennis Prager](http://www.dennisprager.com/). One of his books is 'Happiness is a Serious Problem', in which he discusses things like how you owe it to those around you to not be miserable all the time. It's backwards to wait for someone or something external to cause you happiness. I think if I make the conscious decision to be happy, better health and a better life will follow.
	* Eat Healthy. That's the major point of this whole thing right? While I don't exercise much, and I don't sleep enough, my eating habits are definitely the crux of my issues. Making the commitment to sticking with the TSFL plan and following it through to the achievement of my goals will hopefully transform my life for the better for years to come.
	* Get Active. This one should be pretty easy since I do nothing now. I want to start going on walks or riding my bike daily. This, combined with more healthy eating habits, should greatly enhance my energy levels and general well-being.
