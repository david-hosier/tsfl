title: "Still Going Strong"
---
Wednesday marked my second week on the Medifast Take Shape for Life program, and I'm happy to say that it's going really well still. I've lost just under 13 pounds this last two weeks. That's pretty incredible. I haven't been blogging as much as I thought I would because I expected to be having a hard time, and I planned to use the blog as my outlet to stay focused and vent my tribulations. That just hasn't been the case. The very structured nature of the program has helped me tremendously I think. It has made it easy to stay the course. That's not to say I don't still have cravings or temptations. I do sneak bits here and there, but very rarely.

This plan is not just about losing weight, it's about changing attitudes toward food and helping one develop more healthy habits. I'm eating (and enjoying) things that I never even would have tried before starting this plan. I'm not craving some of the things that I was basically addicted to, like Mountain Dew. My energy level is also a lot more stable and constant. I'm no longer experiencing the highs and lows that I used to, and I'm feeling more motivated to do the things I felt really lazy about in the past.

Overall, I'm extremely happy. I can't wait to see what the next few months have in store.
