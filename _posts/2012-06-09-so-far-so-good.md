title: "So Far So Good"
---
Well, the diet has actually been going pretty well so far. I'm pleasantly surprised to say that the food is not near as bad as I had feared. I actually don't have a problem with most of the food I got. I like the crunch bars, the pudding, the brownies, and the oatmeal the best. I've also been pleasantly surprised by how much food the Lean and Green meal is. Six ounces of chicken breast is quite a lot. Thursday night (my second night) was pretty rough. I felt like complete crap. But besides being constantly mildly hungry, I'm feeling pretty well. I've already lost 7 pounds in three days.
